The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the SQL skills that I have learned and developed through school and online courses.
Within the Covid-19_exploration file, I created new columns that displayed new information that could be of interest such as death percentage within each country.
Within the Data_Cleaning file, I altered and updated the table numerous times in order to show the data in a cleaner manner.
Additionaly withing the data_cleaning file, I removed duplicate rows, utilized if else statements by creating a case and removed unused columns.
